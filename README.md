# anomaly_detection
Achieved accurate anomaly prediction in datasets through the application of
diverse unsupervised machine learning techniques. Employed various
dimensionality reduction methods to detect outliers within the dataset
effectively.
Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis and proficiently
preprocessed the dataset to ensure high data quality.
Utilized advanced techniques such as Dbscan and Isolation Forest to identify
outliers, classifying them as anomalies. Additionally, applied dimensionality
reduction methods like PCA, SVC, and ICA to calculate the reconstruction error,
which served as a basis for predicting anomalies accurately.
